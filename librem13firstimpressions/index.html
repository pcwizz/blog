    <div itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 id="packaging">Packaging</h2>
<p>Dull generic but adequate</p>
<h2 id="look">Look</h2>
<p>Shiny, clean and nice.</p>
<h2 id="built-quality">Built quality</h2>
<p>Fairly good</p>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2>
<p>Not what I'm used to but not problematic.</p>
<p>There is a windows key!</p>
<p>I don't like the shortened right shift key to make room for a function modifier.
Hopefully I cn remap the function modifier to something more useful.</p>
<p>The function keys work as expected.</p>
<h2 id="kill-switches">Kill switches</h2>
<p>They aren't labelled but there are only two so it's not hard to figure out.
Screen</p>
<p>Would be perfect for the size however there is a bit of back light bleed on the
bottom edge. The bleed is not awful and can only be seen on a blacked screen
it's not something that I can't live with our would typically RMA when buying
for personal use.</p>
<h2 id="trackpad">Trackpad</h2>
<p>I don't like trackpads, this one is very big, they get in the way of me typing;
there is a function key to turn it off. I'll get used to it I guess.</p>
<h2 id="noise">Noise</h2>
<p>There is some noise from the air leaving the vents between the lid an the main
body. it's not very loud nor is it distracting; I only noticed it when in the
quietest room in my house. If you have equipped it with a rust platter as I have
then that will be your primary noise creator.</p>
<h2 id="sound-and-speakers">Sound and speakers</h2>
<p>It works; it plays sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile I'm already invested in an
amp/dac and a nice pair of headphones so I don't really care what is built in.</p>
<h2 id="wireless">Wireless</h2>
<p>It's an Atheros chip fully supported by the ath9k driver as it stated on the
campain page. Those of us who give a dam know what that means.</p>
<h2 id="boot">Boot</h2>
<p>Well it didn't come with coreboot. I will be installing coreboot myself so I can
have a grub payload required for /boot to be encrypted.</p>
<h2 id="pure-os">Pure OS</h2>
<p>Mine shipped with pure os not Qubes. In fact I believe mine shipped with RC2. I
didn't like it it didn't seem to have any packages. I installed subgraph rather
quickly after first boot.</p>
