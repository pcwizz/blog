## Packaging

Dull generic but adequate

## Look

Shiny, clean and nice.

## Built quality

Fairly good

## Keyboard

Not what I'm used to but not problematic.

There is a windows key!

I don't like the shortened right shift key to make room for a function modifier.
Hopefully I cn remap the function modifier to something more useful.

The function keys work as expected.

## Kill switches

They aren't labelled but there are only two so it's not hard to figure out.
Screen

Would be perfect for the size however there is a bit of back light bleed on the
bottom edge. The bleed is not awful and can only be seen on a blacked screen
it's not something that I can't live with our would typically RMA when buying
for personal use.

## Trackpad

I don't like trackpads, this one is very big, they get in the way of me typing;
there is a function key to turn it off. I'll get used to it I guess.

## Noise

There is some noise from the air leaving the vents between the lid an the main
body. it's not very loud nor is it distracting; I only noticed it when in the
quietest room in my house. If you have equipped it with a rust platter as I have
then that will be your primary noise creator.

## Sound and speakers

It works; it plays sound. I'm a bit of an audiophile I'm already invested in an
amp/dac and a nice pair of headphones so I don't really care what is built in.

## Wireless

It's an Atheros chip fully supported by the ath9k driver as it stated on the
campain page. Those of us who give a dam know what that means.

## Boot

Well it didn't come with coreboot. I will be installing coreboot myself so I can
have a grub payload required for /boot to be encrypted.

## Pure OS

Mine shipped with pure os not Qubes. In fact I believe mine shipped with RC2. I
didn't like it it didn't seem to have any packages. I installed subgraph rather
quickly after first boot.
