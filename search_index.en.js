blog post is me blowing off steam but maybe it is entertaining. Maybe you\nalso have this pain and we can form some in of support group for for those\naffected by Bitbake or build systems more generally.\nAt my day job I spend a reasonable amount of time fighting with Bitbake.\nBitbake for those of you lucky enough not to maintain an Embedded Linux\ndistribution is the de facto tool for developing Linux distributions targeted\nat embedded devices. Typical use cases range from space craft to loud speakers\ndespite Bitbake being a pain in the arse it is rather prolific and arguable the\nright tool for some of those jobs. Typically one doesn't just use Bitbake, to\nspeed up development a bit, one uses components from the Yocto/OpenEmbedded\nprojects and/or some commercially supported bits and bobs.\nLayers\nBitabake build recipes that tend to output packages or file system images.\nThese recipes contain tasks Bitbake has a standard set of tasks that it\nexecutes in a set order (e.g. do_compile, do_install) although one can\ninject tasks anywhere and/or inject code into existing tasks; more on that mess\nlater. Recipes can import classes to get standard implementations of tasks for\nexample there is a class for Automake so writing recipes for projects that use\nAutomake is relatively easy. The most important feature however is the ability\nto layer collections recipes on top of each over using Bitbake layers.\nLayers are collections of recipes and/or modifications to recipes. The order of\nthe layering is controlled by the order they appear in the bblayers.conf.\nLayers a kinda similar to layers in a Docker file but instead of just adding\nfiles they inject arbitrary code into your build system. Commonly one starts of\nwith poky a layer from the Yocto project that contains all the recipes\nrequired for a bootable system (not necessarily on your target board), adds\nsome other layers from The OpenEmbedded project to fluff out one's userland and\nthe board support package layer from one's SoC vendor, and lastly one's own\nlayer which which one tweaks things and blends everything together into an\nimage recipe that can be flashed to the board or shipped as an update bundle...\nBy the time you have a working Linux system on your board you have anywhere\nbetween 5 and 20 layers. A change in any of these layers can impact any layer\nabove it in a variety of frustrating ways. If you targeting more than one board\nand having more than one flavour of your distribution you will quickly learn to\nexpect collateral damage from layer imports. Lot's of layers love to touch\nrecipes like uboot and Linux. It is always nice to find out one your target\nboards no longer boots because the layer you imported to do something a in a\nflavour that runs on another board changed Squashfs from a built in to a\nmodule...\nOf course developer frustration isn't the only issue with layering arbitrary\nPython/Bash scripts on top of each other. All of these layers come from from\npublic git repositories (unless you are using some commercially supported\nlayers) maintained by the community. While if fairly certain non of these\ncommunity maintained layers is intentionally malicious there is an undeniably\nlarge supply chain risk associated with using them. Just one recipe you use in\none layer you use has to be be altered and the next time you update that layer\nyou image is compromised and you need to rebuild your build infrastructure\nbecause god knows. You need to be monitoring the changes to the layers you use\nbut the complexity of the system doesn't make it easy to see how upstream\nchanges interact with your system. Most layers don't even sign commits so good\nluck securing that supply chain by trust.\nSupply chains are probably the least of your security problems of course. It\nisn't like the versions of things like OpenSSH lag weeks behind security\nupdates, because you are relying on upstream to patch then to update the\nupstream layer in your build pipeline and then to QA it mixed in with whatever\nchanges you have made. Good job no one connects IoT devices directly the\ninternet isn't it...\n_append\nWhat the fuck? Seriously!\nSo in Bitbake you can put _append on the end of any function of variable and\nliterally append an arbitrary string to the end of it. What to prepend well\nthat's no problem either _prepend is the suffix for you. When Bitbake parses\na recipe it spits out a shell script for each task rendering in all of the\nprepends and appends. While your at it you can also specify your target with a\nsuffix like _intel-corei7-64 Which is ugly but compared with the rest of\nBitbake  mild irritation.  The += operator is available or you can inject\nyour own tasks anywhere in the order you like. Why would you do that it boggles\nthe mind.\nIf it's not automake it's a pain\nThis is possible more of a comment on new languages deciding to reinvent\ndependency management in ever more broken ways. Whether it is Go up until\nrelatively recently being very picky out file paths, a rust projects tendency\nto depend on half of crates.io and don't get me started on JavaScript. Bitbake\nhasn't adapted well to this trend of language having their own dependency\nmanagement tooling that usually wants to grab things from the Internet and in\nRust's case run arbitrary code during the compile. I could be grumpy about the\nmodern languages ruining everything with their developer friendly tooling, but\ntheir tolling is pretty nice if you are not trying to build an embedded Linux\nimage with poorly aging tooling.\nYou probably don't need your own Linux Distribution\nIf your application doesn't need a custom kernel or boot loader hacks, you\ndon't need your own distribution. Do your self a favour and buy into a\ncommercially supported IoT distribution. There a plenty of options out there\nfor Embedded Linux you can just ship containers to such as BalenaOS or Ubuntu\ncore.

As AV over IP is deployed in more and more environments it comes into contact with the broader IT community. With broader adoption comes a need for IT professionals to understand AV.  In this post I aim to define AV over IP and provide a brief background on this topic.\nWhat is AV?\nAV typically refers to Audio and Video. For the purpose of this discussion, I also include lighting, rigging, and other systems commonly associated with audio and video setups.\nWhere is AV Used?\nAV technology is pervasive in the modern world, finding application in various settings such as:\n\nTheatres\nConcerts\nConferences\nBroadcasters\nHouses of Worship\nAirports\nTrain stations\n\nSurprisingly, there is a technological overlap among all these diverse locations.\nHow did AV work before IP?\nPreviously, each element operated on its own independent system, often with its\nunique cabling and idiosyncrasies.\nAudio was transmitted as analogue signals over XRL, eventually transitioning to\ndigital through AES3 and various other proprietary vendor-specific protocols,\nsome of which happened to use Ethernet cables but did not communicate using\nEthernet. Microphones and other audio sources were connected to stage boxes,\nwhich were then linked to the mixing console. The mixing console provided the\ncontrol plane for the operator, who then routed the signals to the speakers\nthrough amplifiers.\nVideo was transmitted over SDI, HDMI, and HDBaseT, with the latter effectively\nfunctioning as HDMI over Ethernet cables but not as Ethernet. Notably, HDMI and\nHDBaseT allowed for the tunneling of Ethernet and USB, enabling the possibility\nof IP over AV. Specialized video switcher hardware interacted with a video\nmixing console.\nLighting, rigging, and related systems used DMX512, which could be\ndaisy-chained from a lighting desk or, at times, a laptop to various nodes\n(such as lights, fog machines, winches, etc.). Each daisy chain represented a\nuniverse with 512 channels, quickly consumed by separate color channels like\nred, green, blue, pan, and tilt. Consequently, typical lighting desks supported\nmultiple universes. Although DMX had its dedicated cables, there was also a\nstandard for utilizing Ethernet cables.\nWhy Use IP for AV?\nDealing with different types of cables posed significant challenges, leading\neven non-IP-based AV technologies to incorporate alternative wiring, such as\ncat5e. The ability to use cat5e also meant leveraging existing venue cabling or\ndeploying future-proof cabling, even if the specific usage was unclear at the\ntime.\nMoreover, the issue of distance was resolved in non-IP AV through media\nconverters, facilitating the transition from, for instance, SDI to fiber.\nAn inherent pain point uniquely addressed by IP for AV (apart from passive\noptical solutions) was the multiplexing of multiple elements over the same\ninfrastructure. With IP, audio, video, and lighting signals could all be\ntransmitted over a single cable, eliminating the need for additional wiring.\nOne of the standout features of IP for AV was its extensibility and\nflexibility. The network topology could be adapted to suit the venue and the\nspecific requirements of the event. Granting access to audio streams for\nvarious engineers, such as monitoring, front of house, and broadcast engineers,\nwas as straightforward as providing them with subscription access to the\nstreams on the network.\nIP also introduced the ability to route data. While some Ethernet (L2) based AV\nsolutions could be switched, the option for routing was especially valuable for\nlarger deployments.\nGeneral Approach of AV over IP (AVoIP)\nOpen vendor interoperable standards for audio, video, and lighting over IP\nextensively utilized multicast. Multicast not only reduced bandwidth usage on\nlinks, thus cutting costs, but also decentralized the responsibility of\naccessing multimedia data across the network. This approach transformed the IP\nnetwork into an AV routing matrix, a function previously relegated to separate\ndevices.\nBy leveraging the power of multicast, AVoIP solutions enabled efficient\ndistribution of multimedia data across the network, facilitating seamless\ncommunication and collaboration between various AV devices. The shift towards\nusing the IP network as an AV routing matrix marked a significant evolution in\nthe field, simplifying the overall AV infrastructure and operation. The\nevolution of AV technology represents a departure from the traditional IT\ncomfort zone when it comes to network design and usage.\nMany IT professionals instinctively lean towards minimizing multicast traffic.\nOver decades, conventional IT practices have favoured centralized unicast\nsolutions due to their ease of management, debugging, and security. In a\ntypical network environment, anything that relies on multicast is often\nperceived as an inconvenience, leading administrators to block anything beyond\nthe essentials, such as DHCP, in order to avoid potential complications.\nDealing with misbehaving devices flooding the network with broadcast or 'local\nmulticast' is far from ideal. As a result, it's common practice to block\nconsumer-focused technologies like mDNS within office networks, further\nreducing network noise and complexity.\nGiven this context, it's hardly surprising that there's a substantial lack of\nobservability, manageability, and security when it comes to multicast. For\nthose who expect encryption and authentication in AV over IP, it's important to\nnote that these features are still in the discussion stage. Since the AV\nindustry is one of the rare sectors where multicast serves a legitimate\npurpose, it falls upon the industry to drive the maturation of multicast\ntechnology, bridging the gap to unicast protocols in terms of security and\nreliability.\nHow the AV industry operates?\nThe disparity in networking capabilities goes beyond the technical realm,\nencompassing cultural and knowledge gaps that have significant implications.\nIn many theatres and live performance spaces, the absence of dedicated IT\npersonnel is a common reality. In cases where an IT professional is present,\ntheir responsibilities typically revolve around tasks like managing Wi-Fi\nnetworks and printers for the box office.\nThe individuals tasked with constructing networks in liver performance spaces\nare often AV technicians. Their primary objective is to establish a functional\nand reliable system that operates seamlessly, with minimal need for further\nattention. Consequently, the training AV technicians receive in networking is\noften tailored to the specific requirements of creating a minimal functional\nsetup. For them, the network serves as a tool to facilitate their core\nresponsibilities, such as managing lighting, sound, or video production.\nIn the broadcast sector, while there is typically a greater abundance of\nresources, the regulatory environment and the intricate corporate structures of\nmost broadcasting companies necessitate meticulous long-term planning for any\ntechnological changes. The repercussions of downtime, potential fines, license\nrevocation, and loss of advertising revenue compel broadcasters to adopt a\ncautious approach to technology transformation.\nTo mitigate these risks, engineers within broadcasting organizations undergo\nextensive training to master specific technology stacks, often navigating their\nentire careers within a single technological framework. While broadcasters do\nmaintain dedicated IT and security teams, the risk assessment typically leans\nheavily toward maintaining the status quo to ensure operational stability.\nConclusion\nThe AV industry has discovered innovative ways to utilize IP technology to\nfulfill its specific requirements, and this trend is expected to persist and\nevolve further. However, there are developmental gaps that we, as IT\nprofessionals, have previously encountered in other contexts, presenting an\nopportunity for us to contribute our expertise and guide the AV industry toward\nthe right path. While addressing these gaps may require a significant time\ninvestment, it is essential that we explore temporary mitigations that do not\ndisrupt current operations.\nMoving forward I’m going to continue sharing my thoughts and trying to get in\ncontact with the standards setting bodies (e.g. IPMX, SMTPE, AES).

IF I INTENDED IT TO BE ANY OF THOSE THING I WOULD\nHAVE WRITTEN AND PACKAGED A SCRIPT, CHARGED YOU FOR CONSULTATION OR FILED A BUG\nREPORT IN THE TRACKER. IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SOMETHING READ THE MANUAL AND IF\nYOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND DON'T DO IT!\nIntroduction\nA couple of weeks ago the heavily sand boxed and customized version of\nThunderbird found on Subgraph decided it didn't want to start any more. I\nattempted and failed to get it working again, although I had not tried very\nintently, as I really don't expect GNU+Linux systems to work (that's why this\nserver runs FreeBSD). I gave up on Thunderbird, and decided on trying mutt, as I\nhad been meaning to experiment with mutt for a long time. This is the story of\nmy experience with mutt on Subgraph (which is based on Debian testing): a tale\nof obscurity: an experiment in documentation; I'm writing this article so you\nmight not struggle as I did to make mutt work.\nConfiguration\nThe mutt configuration file is a simple key value type file with variables and a\ncouple of eccentricities. On the whole mutts own documentation on the\nconfiguration file options and syntax is perfectly sound and easy to understand\nto anyone who has edited a *nix configuration file before. If the configuration\nfile syntax is holding you back then you aren't ready to be using a console\nbased email client.\nThe key things your going to want to put in in your configuration file are you\nname, email address, imap and smtp server details. Mutt's own documentation will\nget you this far without hassle. You will probably also want to set a couple of\nthings like requiring TLS on connections to your servers and if you trust your\noperating system and full disk encryption enough you can put you passwords in\nthere too.\nSASL\nIf your running Debian testing, you installed mutt from the repo and your server\nuses SASL for authentication then your configuration isn't going to work yet.\nYour going to have to install libsasl2 from the repository because it's not a\ndependency of the mutt package, which is correct because if your not\nauthenticating with SASL mutt will work just fine or if you are using an\nexternal mailer as opposed to mutts internal mailer mutt will work just fine.\nMake sure libsasl2 is installed before you start researching error messages with\nlittle success. It might be a useful contribution to add libsasl2 to the list of\noptional mutt dependencies in the package; I can't remember whether I have a\nDebian account or not and I'm too busy/lazy at the moment to check; I figure at\nleast having an article on the net might help the average mutt user suffering\nfrom this issue.\nGPG\nThere is plenty of guff about setting up gpg with mutt mostly involving copying\nsome configuration from the internet into a file then including it in your main\nmutt configuration file. It probably works if you store your keys on your\ncomputer and protect them with a password or something, but if like me your keys\nlive on a nitrokey protected with a pin, however it isn't going to work without\nan intense amount of fiddling for the paranoid -like me-.\nIn Debian testing at least all of these instructions you find on forums\n(including the Debian forums) can be safely ignored in favour of using code\nalready baked into the mutt package. GPGME is a API for GPG that is a bit crusty\nbut otherwise functional and mutt can be compiled to use it as it is in the\nDebian testing repository and many other distributions (so I've heard).\nAll you need to do to get GPG working with mutt is enable gpgme in you mutt\nconfiguration as described on the Arch wiki entry for mutt. You will most likely\nwant to set automatic signing and encrypting of replies.\nHTML\nI don't read HTML emails. When I get HTML emails I respond to them asking for\nthe same information in plane text. HTML doesn't play nice with PGP and I don't\nunderstand what purpose they serve. If you need to send something formatted send\nit as an attachment or like to it in the email body.\nIf you don't share my enlightened thinking I believe there are simple methods of\ndumping HTML mail with external programs. I wouldn't bother though.\nKeyboard short cuts\nThe defaults seem fine for me, so I haven't changed them, I prefer to minimise\nthis sort of customisation to ensure I can still use other peoples set ups (if\nrequired) even if I lose a tiny amount of potential work flow optimisation. The\nquestion mark is the most important key to remember, it gives you a list of key\nbindings in that view (mode or whatever they call the difference screens in\nmutt), if your a vim user then your going to feel fairly comfortable rather\nquickly.\nVim\nMy chosen editor is vim, I use vim for everything that requires text to be\nedited, it just works. If you like you could have mutt specific vim some\nadditional configuration using file types. The mutt page of the arch wiki covers\nconfiguration vim for mutt. You might enjoy spell checking and 72 character text\nwidth, however my vim configuration already has easy access to spell check and\nI'm unlikely to ever send a table or something that is sensitive to text width\nin an email body, the option is their if you want it.\nMultiple email address and PGP keys\nI haven't bothered setting this up yet. All my mail is redirected into the\naccount I've set up and I'm only using PGP with that account at the moment. I\nwill at some point add the multiple outgoing email accounts. A task for some\nspare cycles will be to create a key pair for my fsfe.org account on my\nfellowship smart card. I have spotted a couple of ways to do it in the\ndocumentation, but setting up keys to satisfy manner my paranoia finds\nacceptable takes a good hour, so it might happen within a couple of weeks.\nTor all of the things\nTor is also on my list of things I should configure mutt to use. I don't think\nmutt's built in MTA understands proxing, so I have two options, I will have to\nuse an other MTA or wrap mutt in torsocks. I'm not entirely happy about the\nprospect of giving precedences to a folder in my home directory in my path\nvariable, so I'll probably be able to live with typing \"torsocks mutt\".\n","id":"https://pcwizz.net/mutteringsonmutt/","title":"Mutterings on mutt"},"https://pcwizz.net/programming/":{"body":"The following content contains thoughts on programming mostly in Go and Rust.\nI make no claim on these thoughts being original or coherent.\nMy hope is that this is somehow interesting.\nEnjoy!\nLet's start with why Go is a suboptimal language.\nGo is preferable to many other languages,\nbut I increasingly find myself cursing its flaws.\nGo has great support for concurrency,\non the one hand it gives your nice tools to do everything right,\non other hand in lures developers into creating inordinately complex webs of\nchannels and routines for what are essentially synchronous tasks.\nError handling is explicit,\nwhich is an excellent reminder that unexpected things happen,\nhowever errors can be simply ignored with an _ as they are merely convention.\nGo has one of the best garbage collectors implementations available,\nbut there are still plenty of ways to introduce unsoundness in the language,\nnot leaking is only part of the struggle.\nInterfaces are great,\ncompose-able interfaces are better,\nimplicitly implementing interfaces is insanity.\nSometimes I just need Generics,\nor even just macros,\ninstead Go gives me a templating library and go generate.\nNow that that venting is over with,\nit's worth considering why Go is so popular despite the frustrations.\nThe headline arguments are:\nit's fast (relative to other GC'd languages),\nit's a small languages (not so many incantations to remember),\nthere is already a library for everything,\nit is established enough now that \"enterprises\" have caught up.\nThe honest answers are:\nGo routines sound cool,\nmanagers have hear of it,\nthe tool chain isn't massive pain to setup.\nWhat do I actually care about when programming?\nI don't care so much about performance,\nat least not at first,\nbecause that is premature optimisation.\nI'm not that bothered about syntax,\nas long as my editor has good language integration.\nWhat I really want to know is:\ncan I build a mental model of what is going on without loosing my mind,\nare there ergonomic ways to do common things,\nwill the code fail quietly at runtime.\nThat last thing especially,\nI can live with pretty much anything,\nbut if it as obscure runtime behaviours I'm more likely to resent that tool.\nPrograms should fail early and loudly,\npreferably before I've left my editor,\nhopefully on build,\nand almost never in production.\nWhen Rust berates me for trying to do something unsound I thank it,\nby nagging me at build time it has saved me production debugging stress,\nhours invested fighting the borrow checker are worth every second.\nWith Go the feedback is often a bit more delayed,\nwaiting for unit tests or even integration tests before showing strangeness,\nof course it being Go many bugs are racy (-race doesn't catch everything).\nWell at lease compiled languages are a step up from interpreted languages,\ndays spent attaching IRB to poorly maintained Ruby apps are best avoided,\ninteractive debuggers (Delve, rust-lldb) are more than enough.\nCode should be in declarative style,\nimperative code is reserved for edge cases.\nRust strikes a nice balance,\nmost thinks can be down very clearly declaratively,\nwhile I still have the option to write imperative code as required.\nObjects should be immutable by default,\nhaving to say I want this to be mutable encourages good design,\nmost of the time readability is a higher priority than performance.\nUnit tests should be extensive,\nmost dumb manual checks done during development should become an automated test,\nit save you time, me time, and makes the test gods happier.\nSoftware these days rarely exists in isolation,\nintegration test everything exhaustively,\nor prepare for a game of debugging in production.\nStaging environments are not integration tests,\nstaging is where you hope to catch holes in your tests.\nIf tests \"take to long\" your development process is probably broken,\notherwise think about parallelising tests.\nThis concludes my jumble of thoughts for the moment.\nHappy hacking!\n","id":"https://pcwizz.net/programming/","title":"Programming"},"https://pcwizz.net/talk-rust-and-tell-sept-2019/":{"body":"I put together a short prevention on where I see Rust offering some nice\npatterns for developing service automations; database automation with Rust.

This posts uses STRIDE and\nDREAD to asses some of the typical the threats posed in an AVoIP environment.\nthe If you are not familiar with AVoIP you may wish to read my first post\nintroducing the topic.\nSpoofing\nSpoofing is the ability to pretend to be something or someone other than\nyourself. What this means in an AVoIP context is for example one microphone\npretending to be another or even some other device pretending to be a\nmicrophone. In an ideal world we would desire the ability to verify the\nauthenticity of a device.\n\nIs this really the microphone a the lectern or is it some other device on the network masquerading as the audio source we seek?\n\nIn addition to the authenticity of devices we also want to be confident of the\nauthenticity of streams on the network. Once we have established that a device\nis authentic we would also like to know that the stream containing all of the\naudio channels from stage left is authentic and not another stream attempting to\ndeceive us.\nOnce we have established that the streams are authentic we are also concerned\nthat the data in those streams is authentic. If someone else can impersonate the\nsame stream with the same parameters as the legitimate stream we would like to\nable to distinguish the legitimate from the illegitimate data and only work with\nthe legitimate data. I have given a talk about the opportunities to carry out\nsuch an attack on Audio over IP protocols.\nThe real world consequences of spoofing could cause quite some chaos in many\nAVoIP deployments. If someone mixing media streams can’t trust their\nauthenticity then the output is also potentially inauthentic.\nCurrent AVoIP technology doesn’t do anything technical to address threats from\nspoofing. It is assumed the network perimeter is secure and it is the\nresponsibility of the operator to select the correct streams from the correct\ndevices. It is a far from ideal state of affairs, however the madness that would\nensue would lead to relatively swift detection and remediation; an operator\nwould likely hear/see the difference.\nTampering\nTampering is about the integrity of of our AVoIP streams. Can we trust that the\ndata sent (from an authentic source) is the data we receive and use. Tampering\ncan be done from a person in the middle position such as a switch or a router.\nMixing consoles and other processing devices tamper with content by design\nhowever we expect this as intended behaviour so in this context we will place\nsuch devices out of scope.\nIf an attacker can alter the content of our streams in flight across the network\nwe can’t rely on the integrity of what we are receiving. The implications of\nthis could be that a presenter is saying one thing and a different thing is\nbeing played out to the audience.\nMost smaller AVoIP networks don’t route streams so there would only be\nrelatively low power switches on the network with which to carry out this\nattack. Larger installs for example at broadcasters definitely do have capable\nrouting hardware. There is also the option that the attacker gains physical\naccess to insert themselves a person in the middle.\nCurrent AVoIP technology doesn’t have any technical counter measures to prevent\ntampering and protect the integrity of the content. The integrity and security\nof the network is assumed. Carrying out such an attack would likely attract\nattention, however used subtly or burnt once for the right motivations it is\npossible to imagine this capability being useful for someone.\nRepudiation\nRepudiation is about wether an action can be repudiated or not. In other words\ncan we prove that a users did a thing (e.g. did the FoH engineer hit the mute\nbutton). As we are dealing with a professional environment the target is for\nactions to be non-repudiable.\nIn certain AV environments it is important that actions are not disputable for\nregulatory purposes. Radio stations (in most countries) must not have long\nsilences otherwise they will face fines. In a theatre if a winch is operated\nunexpectedly during a performance resulting in an injury it is important to be\nable to establish why.\nNon-repudability to the user level would require cooperation from the end\ndevices to provide logs of such actions. On the network we can use normal\nnetwork visibility tools such as collecting NetFlow (using NetFlow has short\nhand for the type of data not necessarily the protocol from Cisco) data from\nswitches/routers. Network based collection can indicate as to wether something\nodd was happening at the time (e.g. spoofing) although it doesn’t provide\nnon-repudability by itself.\nNetwork collection in AVoIP networks is uncommon. Full take capture would be\nfairly expensive when dealing with high bitrate audio and video, however\ncollecting NetFlow should be the norm even if it currently isn’t. There are also\nsome specific AVoIP data sources on the network that would also be valuable to\ncollect over time such as stream advertisements via SAP or mDNS.\nMost smaller utility appliances don’t provide any ability to send logs. More\nfeature rich device may provide logs. Any logs would be better than no logs even\nif it could be time consuming to configure log collection from every capable\nendpoint.\nInformation disclosure\nInformation disclosure is allowing access to data to unauthorized parties. In\nAVoIP we are principally concerned with the content of our communications the\naudio and video, however the metadata may also be interesting.\nThe media industry tends to concern itself with the protection of copyright they\ntherefor don’t take kindly to attackers being able to copy their content. Home\nusers may be familiar with HDCP which is employed to ensure that content can\nonly be played back on devices that are certified (among other criteria) to\ncomply with the industries demands.\nAnother concern is that an attacker may be able to snoop on a hot microphone or\ncamera feed which could create some reputational problems for everyone involved.\nThere is a proposal to integrate HDCP with AVoIP however at the time of writing\nI’m not aware of any production implementations. HDCP also only addresses\ninformation discloser In the broadest sense that the protected content will only\nbe reproduced on certified devices, the proposals do not provide any way to\nfurther restrict access (for instance just devices that should be part of this\ninstallation). As it stands you can plug in a device to an AVoIP network join a\nmulticast group and grab all of the streams.\nThere might be some benefit from HDCP in that devices will grow the capability\nto decrypt/encrypt streams with low latency/jitter which can be repurposed with\na more appropriate key exchange and authorization system.\nCurrently defence against information disclosure relies on the network being\nsecure.\nDenial of service\nDenial of service is an unavoidable problem especially for AVoIP. Where on\nanother network you could block multicast to reduce the opportunity for flooding\nin AVoIP multicast is core functionality so one has to live with it to some\nextent. What can be done is avoiding amplification bugs, segmentation, and\nmonitoring NetFlow against a baseline.\nIt is common for AVoIP to have 2 separate networks with each device connected to\nonce which does protect against accidental denials of service such as someone\nbuilding a L2 network loop.\nElevation of privilledge\nElevation of privilege is interesting as there is no concept of privilege in\nAVoIP. However It may be that one engineer may be permitted to change the EQ in\na mixing console another operator is not allowed to perform such an action. If\nthe operator has access to the network it may not be possible them to change the\nEQ in the mixing console, but they can certainly route the stream via their own\ndevice and apply the EQ they want there which is more of an authentication\nbypass.\nWe can gather from this that network access in AVoIP is effectively root in a\n*nix system or domain admin in the Windows world.\nDREAD\nNow that we have looked at the categories of threats it is time to asses their\nimpact with some specific attacks. We will dispense with “Discoverability” as it\ndefinitely isn’t very useful in a public blogpost. All scores are 1 (lowest) to\n10 (highest). For “Affected users” we consider the audience (4 points),\nperformers (2 points), technicians (2 points) and copyright holders (2 points). \nAttackDamageReliabilityExploitabilityAffected usersTotal score\nImpersonating an audio source stream such as a microphone via mDNS/SAP.3109820\nImpersonating a devices configuration interface.1105218\nImpersonating an audio output stream such as a from a mixing console to speakers via mDNS/SAP.7108833\nOverwriting a stream from a man on the side position using packet timing.876829\nTampering with a stream from a man in the middle position.884828\nControlling DMX devices such as winches and hoists by sending art-net packets to the right addresses.101010838\nRecording audio/video output streams from the network.31010225\nRecording audio/video input streams such as from “muted” microphones.41010418\nFlooding multicast groups with traffic to perform denial of service.31010821\n\nConclusion\nAVoIP has a large attack surface with potential impacts raging from copyright\ninfringement to physical injury and very few security considerations in the\nprotocol design. Network level mitigations are available and could be effective\nin reducing risk through timely detection and response. However there is a lot\nof work to be done to bring a concept of security to the ecosystem. Any progress\nmust take into account that most installs do not have a security person let\nalone a network/security operation centre, so solutions must be accessible to\nthe technicians already in the building (to the extent that they can at least\nidentify an issue and call someone).\n","id":"https://pcwizz.net/threatmodellingavoipenvironments/","title":"Threat modelling AVoIP environments"}},"docInfo":{"https://pcwizz.net/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://pcwizz.net/embeddedlinuxarantaboutbitbake/":{"body":635,"title":4},"https://pcwizz.net/insidethelibrem13/":{"body":321,"title":3},"https://pcwizz.net/introavoip4it/":{"body":800,"title":5},"https://pcwizz.net/librem13firstimpressions/":{"body":177,"title":4},"https://pcwizz.net/mutteringsonmutt/":{"body":585,"title":2},"https://pcwizz.net/programming/":{"body":379,"title":1},"https://pcwizz.net/talk-rust-and-tell-sept-2019/":{"body":23,"title":5},"https://pcwizz.net/thoughtsongo/":{"body":280,"title":2},"https://pcwizz.net/threatmodellingavoipenvironments/":{"body":852,"title":4}},"length":10},"lang":"English"};
